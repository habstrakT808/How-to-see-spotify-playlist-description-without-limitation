## üîß Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Spotify account
- Spotify Developer credentials

## üì• Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spotify-playlist-extractor.git
   cd spotify-playlist-extractor
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   Or install directly:
   ```bash
   pip install spotipy pandas
   ```

## üîë Setting Up Spotify Developer Account

### Step 1: Create a Spotify Developer Account

1. Visit [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and log in with your Spotify account

### Step 2: Create a New Application

1. Click the **Create App** button
2. Fill in the application details:
   - **App name**: Enter a name for your application (e.g., "My Playlist Extractor")
   - **App description**: Brief description of your app (e.g., "Application to extract Spotify playlist information including descriptions and metadata")
   - **Redirect URI**: Enter `http://localhost:8000/callback` (this is where users will be redirected after authentication)
   - **Which API/SDKs are you planning to use?**: Select "Web API"
   - Check the terms of service agreement box
3. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Get Your Credentials

1. After creating your app, you'll be taken to the app's dashboard
2. Note your **Client ID** (visible on the dashboard)
3. Click **View Client Secret** to reveal and copy your Client Secret
4. Keep these credentials secure - you'll need them to authenticate with the Spotify API

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Option 1: Environment Variables (Recommended)

Set your Spotify API credentials as environment variables:

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID='your_client_id'
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET='your_client_secret'
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
set SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
set SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```

### Option 2: Direct Input

If you don't set environment variables, the program will prompt you to enter your credentials when you run it.

## üöÄ Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python spotify_playlist_extractor.py
```

Follow the prompts:

1. Enter the URL or ID of the Spotify playlist you want to extract
2. View basic playlist information
3. Choose whether to download full track data
4. Select output format (CSV and/or JSON)

### Example Output

The script will generate some information and two files:

1. `playlist_data.csv`: Contains all track information with playlist metadata
2. `playlist_info.json`: Contains detailed playlist information

## üìä Data Analysis

Once you have exported your playlist data, you can:

- Open the CSV file in Excel, Google Sheets, or any spreadsheet software for analysis
- Use the JSON data in other applications or scripts
- Analyze trends in your music taste
- Discover your most played artists and albums

## üîç Example Code

Here's a basic example of how the extraction works:

```python
import spotipy
from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyClientCredentials

# Set up Spotify client
client_credentials_manager = SpotifyClientCredentials(
    client_id='your_client_id', 
    client_secret='your_client_secret'
)
sp = spotipy.Spotify(client_credentials_manager=client_credentials_manager)

# Get playlist information
playlist_id = 'spotify:playlist:37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M'  # Today's Top Hits
playlist = sp.playlist(playlist_id)

# Print basic information
print(f"Name: {playlist['name']}")
print(f"Owner: {playlist['owner']['display_name']}")
print(f"Description: {playlist['description']}")
print(f"Tracks: {playlist['tracks']['total']}")
```

## üìù Limitations

- The Spotify Web API has rate limits that may affect large-scale data extraction
- In development mode, your application can access data for up to 25 Spotify accounts
- Some playlist metadata may be limited based on privacy settings
